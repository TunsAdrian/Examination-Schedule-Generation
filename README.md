# Examination Schedule Generation
Examination schedule semi-automatic generator, based on logical hard/soft constraints. A presentation of the general functionality of the application can be checked [here](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Examination-Schedule-Generation/blob/master/documentation/Presentation.pdf), and a comprehensive documentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/TunsAdrian/Examination-Schedule-Generation/blob/master/documentation/Documentation.pdf).

In order to run the project, this [Z3 SMT solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) is needed.

For python it needs to be installed with: `pip3 install z3-solver`

If PyCharm is used as an IDE, the virtual environment (venv) needs to be first turned off, with the `deactivate` command.
